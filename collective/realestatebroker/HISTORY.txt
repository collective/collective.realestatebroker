2.0.3 rc4 (2008-07-02)
----------------------

- Creating our own img tags from catalog brains instead of doing a
  .getObject() to use archetypes tag() method which wakes up the
  object. [reinout]


2.0.3 rc3 (2008-06-25)
----------------------

- Fixed strange attributeerror on plone 3.1.2. Moving to that plone version
  fixes a kss bug in the album view. [reinout]


2.0.3 rc2 (2008-06-25)
----------------------

- Added optional max_height attribute to insert_image() to allow protection
  for overly large portrait image on the pdf's homepage. [reinout]

- Added css class to table cells that contain an image in the res/comm
  listings so that the image can be aligned vertically if desired. [reinout]

- Added caching of rendered pdf in an annotation. Saves a lot of cpu
  time. [reinout]


2.0.3 rc1 (released)
--------------------

- Moved rent_buy to the financial schemata for the edit view so that all
  financial fields are on the same screen. [fredvd]

- Added a field for indicating if the price is a fixed price or is still
  negotiable. Not used (yet) in the collective.realestatebroker package view
  templates, but can be exposed in your own template overrides [fredvd]


2.0.2 (released 2008-04-21)
---------------------------

- no changes, make a final release for references [fredvd]


2.0.1 rc4 (released 2008-03-06)
-------------------------------
- Add new rented state and accompanying transition so that rented houses
  have a proper listing [fred]


2.0.1 rc3 (released 2008-02-29)
-------------------------------

2.0.1 rc2 (released 2008-02-04)
-------------------------------

2.0.1 rc (released 2008-02-04)
------------------------------

- Fixed bug in display of houses/offices: the main thumbnail picture now
  points at /album instead of /photo. /photo could result in an orgy of
  redirects. [reinout]

2.0.1 beta3 (released 2008-01-25)
---------------------------------

- Google maps' js is only enabled if the url ends on '/map' now, so the other
  tabs don't have to load it. [reinout]

- Changed sort_order in the realestate view, so that 'new' real estate
  objects are always on top of the list. These are the most interesting for
  visitors checking your real_estate. [fred]

- Removed size limit on the construction year field. This allows you to add
  '2007-2008' as a construction year, for instance. [reinout]

2.0.1 beta2 (released 2008-01-17)
---------------------------------

  to a login page). [Reinout]
