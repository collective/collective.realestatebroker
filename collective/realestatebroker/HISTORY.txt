History of collective.realestatebroker
======================================

2.0.1 rc3 (unreleased)
----------------------

- Fixed test to reflect change done in rc2. [reinout]

- add house_type to the portal_catalog index (getHouse_type) [fred]

2.0.1 rc2 (released 2008-02-04)
-------------------------------

  the edit form. [reinout]

2.0.1 rc (released 2008-02-04)
------------------------------

- Fixed bug in display of houses/offices: the main thumbnail picture now
  points at /album instead of /photo. /photo could result in an orgy of
  redirects. [reinout]

2.0.1 beta3 (released 2008-01-25)
---------------------------------

- Google maps' js is only enabled if the url ends on '/map' now, so the other
  tabs don't have to load it. [reinout]

- Changed sort_order in the realestate view, so that 'new' real estate
  objects are always on top of the list. These are the most interesting for
  visitors checking your real_estate. [fred]

- Removed size limit on the construction year field. This allows you to add
  '2007-2008' as a construction year, for instance. [reinout]

2.0.1 beta2 (released 2008-01-17)
---------------------------------

- Added manager-only textual search form to the listing templates. [reinout]

---------------------------------

- Capitalized the 'view' action so that the translation is picked up. [reinout]

- Dutch translation fix ("opslag"). [reinout]

  for every skin.

2.0 rc6
-------

  to a login page). [Reinout]

2.0 rc
------

- Translated the schemata names and the workflow names (in a separate
  old-style Product: reb_i18n) [Reinout van Rees]
