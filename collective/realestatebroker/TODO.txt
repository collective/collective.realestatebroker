Control panel:
--------------

- Form buttons in control panel are untranslated

- Control panel uses default list editing widget, not UI friendly for
  larger lists

Templates:
----------

- Rent/buy pricing info in a commercial listing is unlogical if you want to
  list two prices for both rent and buy

- In a residential content object in the view, a 'by admin - last change'
  line appears in the middle of the page.

Setup/Config:
-------------

- Generic Setup has problems with supplying unicode characters to for
  example the currency property.

- Entering Euro sign for currency and use of other extended character in the
  control panel only works for FireFox at the moment. IE and Safari mangle
  the encoding. Unverified whether this is a zope.formlib or browser
  problem.

Python:
-------

- Refactor and move cooked_price and dotted_price to utils.py
