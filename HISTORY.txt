Temporary space for 'in development' changes for the Plone 3.0 upgrade.

Properties:
- merge realestate_properties and realbusiness_properties into one 
  realestatebroker_properties file
- renamed fields:
  isolation -> insulation
  type -> house_type
- Added commercial_ and residential_ prefixes for property value lists being
  only used in residential or commercial contenttypes.
