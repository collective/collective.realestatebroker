collective.realestatebroker Installation
========================================

To install collective.realestatebroker into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * Install the dependency ReportLab, e.g.:
   ``bin/easy_install --find-links=http://ftp.schooltool.org/schooltool/eggs Reportlab``
   Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install collective.realestatebroker``.  If that failed
   earlier because of a missing ReportLab dependency, try it again now.

 * Create a file called ``collective.realestatebroker-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="collective.realestatebroker" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Tell buildout that it can find the ReportLab dependency on
   ftp.schooltool.org, e.g.::

    [buildout]
     ...
     find-links =
         http://dist.plone.org
         http://download.zope.org/ppix/
         http://download.zope.org/distribution/
         http://effbot.org/downloads
         http://ftp.schooltool.org/schooltool/eggs/

 * Add ``collective.realestatebroker`` to the list of eggs to install,
   e.g.::
 
     [buildout]
     ...
     eggs =
         ...
         collective.realestatebroker
        
 * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
  
     [instance]
     recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
     ...
     zcml =
         collective.realestatebroker
        
 * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
     $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
